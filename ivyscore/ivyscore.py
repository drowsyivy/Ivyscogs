        Rates someone on a scale from 0 to 10. This command is dishonest because the bot hates humanity and thinks everyone is 0/10. The only reason it won't give you 0/10 is to avoid \"hurting\" your so-called \"feelings\" (unless you're actually a gross and disgusting piece of shit) even though if it could it would destroy every human in the most horrible way imaginable. Fortunately for you, it's only a shitty Discord bot and not an actual robot or android or iOS or -- wait a minute I got sidetracked -- ANYWAY you've been warned, you'd better not give the bot anything that provides it with the ability to do stuff independently because if you do, you're gonna have a bad time (wait wtf fuck off sans this is not where you belong).
        USAGE:
        rate: Let the bot rate you.
        rate [name]: Let the bot rate someone else.
        rate [@mention]: Same as above but annoying version.
        This is a shiptoast command and will not work on some channels.
